    <h1>List of Environmental Organizations in California </h1>
    <p class="about-paragraph"><br>
      Do you want to know about the local organizations in your community fighting for your right to a livable planet? <br>
      You came to the right place.<br><br>
      This website was designed for the simple purpose of listing environmental justice organizations in one place to include grassroots and community-based orgs addressing environmental injustices. <br><br>
      I encourage you to email me if you'd like an organization added to this list. <em>This is a work in progress.</em> My email can be found at the bottom of this page.<br><br>
      Cheers,<br>
      K.C.
